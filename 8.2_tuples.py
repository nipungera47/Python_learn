# Tuples using python

t = (1,2,4,1,1,1,5)
t1 = () #empty tuple

t2=(1,) # tuple with single element, so we should place comma after the single element
# printing the elements of the tuple
print(t[0])


# list and tuples are different things
# we cannot update tuples
# t[0] = 34 This will throw an error


print(t1)


# built in methods we can use in tuple

print(t.count(1)) # it will tell the number of times we have printed 1 in the tuple.

print(t.index(5))
